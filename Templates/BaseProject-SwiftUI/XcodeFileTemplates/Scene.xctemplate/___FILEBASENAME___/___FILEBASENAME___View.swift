// README:
// A SwiftUI view that represents the UI component for the ___VARIABLE_productName___ module.
//
// This view uses the `___VARIABLE_productName___ViewModel` as its view model to provide data and handle business logic.
// It initializes the view model and displays the view's content using SwiftUI's `View` protocol.
//
// Components:
// - `@StateObject`: A property wrapper that manages the lifecycle of the view model.
// - `___VARIABLE_productName___ViewModel`: The view model providing data and logic for the view.
// - `Text`: A SwiftUI view that displays a text label with the view model's state.
//
// Instructions:
// 1. Ensure that `___VARIABLE_productName___ViewModel` is implemented and conforms to the necessary protocols
//    to provide the data required by this view.
// 2. Customize the UI components and layout in the `body` property to meet the design requirements of your application.
// 3. Remove this README comment once the view has been fully implemented and customized.
//
// Note: This README comment is provided for initial setup and should be deleted after you have finalized the view implementation.

    ///
    /// - Important: Always initialize the `viewModel` property inside the `init()` method rather than directly
    ///   in its property declaration. This ensures that the view model is properly instantiated and managed 
    ///   by SwiftUI’s state management system. Direct initialization in the property declaration may lead to 
    ///   unexpected behavior or state management issues.

        _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: ___VARIABLE_productName___ViewModel())
