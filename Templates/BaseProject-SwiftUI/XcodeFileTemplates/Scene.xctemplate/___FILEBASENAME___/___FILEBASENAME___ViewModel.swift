//
// README:
// A SwiftUI `ObservableObject` class that represents the view model for the ___VARIABLE_productName___ module.
//
// This class uses the `@MainActor` attribute to ensure that all updates to the `state` are performed on the main thread,
// which is crucial for UI updates. The class conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol to allow SwiftUI views
// to observe and react to changes in its state.
//
// Components:
// - `@Published`: A property wrapper that publishes changes to the `state` property, notifying any observing
//   SwiftUI views to update accordingly.
// - `state`: An instance of `State` that holds the data for the view model.
// - `init()`: Initializes the `state` property with a new instance of `State`.
// - `send(_ action: Action)`: A method to handle actions and update the state accordingly. This method should
//   be implemented with specific actions and state updates based on your application's requirements.
// 
// Instructions:
// 1. Define the `State` struct or class that represents the view model's state, and customize it as needed.
// 2. Implement the `send(_ action: Action)` method to handle various actions that affect the state. Update the
//    `switch` statement with cases for different actions and logic to modify the state.
// 3. Always make sure that any other helper methods are marked as `private` to ensure that they are only accessible
//    within the class and not exposed externally. This maintains encapsulation and prevents unintended use.
// 4. Ensure that helper methods follow functional programming principles: they should take the current state as input, perform operations, and return a new state without mutating the original state or causing side-effects.
//
// Note on Functional Programming:
// - Immutability: Avoid mutating the state directly. Instead, return a new instance of the state with the desired changes.
// - Pure Functions: Helper methods should avoid side effects, meaning they only operate on their inputs and do not rely on or alter external states.
//
// Example of pure function implementation: 
// The `performSomeLogic()` method is designed as a pure function that takes the current state and returns a new, updated state.
//
// Note: This README comment is provided for initial setup and should be deleted after you have finalized the view model implementation.

final class ___FILEBASENAMEASIDENTIFIER___: ObservableObject {

    /// Initializes the view model with a default `State`.
    ///
    /// - Note: Ensure that the `State` type is defined and properly set up to represent the data for this view model.

        self.state = State()
    }

    /// Handles actions and updates the state accordingly.
    /// 
    /// - Parameter action: An instance of `Action` representing the action to be processed.

    func send(_ action: Action) {
        switch action {
            // Add cases to handle different actions
        }
    }

    // Pure function to update the state.
    // This function does not mutate the current state but instead returns a new, updated state.
    // 
    // - Parameter state: The current state.
    // - Returns: A new state with updated properties.
    // - Note: 
    // - Pure functions should not cause side effects. Always return a new state instance and avoid direct mutation.
    // - All helper methods should be declared `private` to ensure encapsulation.
    private func performSomeLogic(for state: State) -> State {
        // Create and return a new state based on the input state
        var newState = state
        newState.title = "Updated Title"
        return newState
    }
